Metal halide perovskites have garnered a great deal of attention in recent years due to their desirable properties for optoelectronics. However, progress in their commercial utilization has been hampered by their stability and the environmental concerns of using lead. In recent years, numerous studies have been dedicated to the discovery and synthesis of novel lead free perovskites, namely a subclass of perovskites known as double perovskites. Therefore, it has been a privilege to highlight the recent computational developments towards discovering promising lead-free halide double perovskites in our recent review paper published in [Materials Today](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mattod.2020.11.026).
