In our recent collaborative [study](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.0c08897), we elucidate the source of spectral instability in quasi-2D mixed halide perovskites using experimentation (by our collaborators) and atomistic modeling. Namely, experiments and density functional theory computations analyzed the halide redistribution mechanisms which we believe are responsible for this observed phenomena.
