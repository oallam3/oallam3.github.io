My first experience as a Graduate Teaching Assistant has been a rewarding one. I had the pleasure to work with over 50 students this summer who are learning about engineering thermodynamics. I am very grateful to receive recognition from the Georgia Tech Center for Teaching and Learning. I look forward to a new semester working with students!
