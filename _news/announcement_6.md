In our [latest study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/inf2.12277), we investigate the utility of organic hybrid 3D frameworks composed of carbon quantum dot and reduced graphene oxide (CQD - rGO) as novel cathode materials for Li-, Na-, and K-ion batteries. Density functional theory and experimentation uncovered the structure - electrochemical activity trends of the CQD - rGO hybrids. The results offer valuable insights for the highly promising application of CQDs in batteries using relatively earth abundant alkali metals such as Na and K.
