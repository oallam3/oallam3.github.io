For the first time, we study the [effect of operating temperatures on Li–oxygen cells in the presence of carbon dioxide](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2022.137744). Density functional theory calculations shed light on the experimentally observed temperature-dependent discharge mechanisms and electrolyte stability. Our study highlights the importance of assessing the practical utility of Li–oxygen cells (in the presence of carbon dioxide and temperature changes), which is necessary prior to a future commercialization operating under air.
