<strong>Greetings!</strong> I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech, where I work at the intersection of the [Computational NanoBio Technology Lab](https://cnbt.mse.gatech.edu) and the [Energy Storage and Conversion Lab](https://escl.gatech.edu), advised by [Prof. Seung Soon Jang](https://research.gatech.edu/seung-soon-jang) and [Prof. Seung Woo Lee](https://research.gatech.edu/seung-woo-lee).

I am also a PhD Resident at [Google X](https://x.company) where I on developing and utilizing sophisticated computational chemistry and machine learning pipelines to expedite novel materials exploration for one of X's high profile confidential projects.

In academia, my research interests have been driven by a passion for exploring the potential of a wide range of materials for energy storage and conversion applications. To achieve this, I employ a diverse array of computational methods, including <strong>density functional theory</strong>, <strong>molecular dynamics</strong>, and <strong>machine learning</strong>, in close collaboration with experimental partners. By harnessing the power of these techniques, I aim to uncover new insights into material properties and design guidelines to pave the way for the development of innovative, sustainable energy solutions.

As a Ph.D. candidate, I am committed to not only advancing the frontiers of scientific knowledge but also sharing my expertise and fostering a deeper understanding of computational materials science among my peers and the wider scientific community. Thank you for visiting my website, and I invite you to explore my research, publications, and other academic endeavors.
