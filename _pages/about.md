<p>At SandboxAQ, I develop frameworks that integrate quantum mechanics and machine learning to accelerate and automate the evaluation of complex heterogeneous reaction mechanisms. My focus is on scaling from atomic-level interactions to mesoscale phenomena, driving advancements in material science.</p>

<p>Previously, I was the <strong>Computational Chemistry + ML PhD Resident</strong> at <strong>Google X</strong>, where I worked on automating materials discovery for high-impact, confidential projects. I built AI-driven tools designed to push the limits of molecular and materials innovation.</p>

<p>In my work, I collaborate closely with experimental partners across academia and industry to harness AI and computational simulations for delivering real breakthroughs in material design.</p>

<p>Outside of research, you can often find me hiking, cooking up new dishes, mountain biking, or expanding my collection of vintage briar wood pipes.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out if you're interested in AI-accelerated materials discovery or want to explore collaboration opportunities!</p>
