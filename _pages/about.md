<p>Research Scientist at <strong><a href="https://www.sandboxaq.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">SandboxAQ</a></strong>. Current work builds AI systems that correct gaps in physics and stay reliable when conditions shift. This aimed at faster, trustworthy discovery in catalysis and energy storage.</p>

<p>Before that: <strong><a href="https://x.company" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Google X</a></strong> (Alphabetâ€™s AI skunkworks). Focused on autonomous materials design and fast simulation-to-decision loops on secret projects.</p>

<p>Recent focus: strategies that fold in new physics (e.g., magnetism and fidelity changes) without forgetting what already works, so models generalize instead of drifting.</p>

<p>Reach out if you want to chat about AI-for-materials, atomistic simulation, and ideas that might be risky but useful.</p>
