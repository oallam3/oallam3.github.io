<p>I am a <i>Research Scientist</i> at <strong><a href="https://www.sandboxaq.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">SandboxAQ</a></strong>. I work on AI-driven materials discovery. I build models and workflows for atomistic simulation problems, with an emphasis on reliability when chemistry, structure, or simulation settings change. Current focus areas include catalysis and electrochemical energy storage.</p>

<p>I earned my PhD from <strong><a href="https://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Georgia Tech</a></strong>. I worked across the <a href="https://www.mse.gatech.edu/people/seung-soon-jang" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Computational NanoBio Technology Lab</a> led by <a href="https://www.mse.gatech.edu/people/seung-soon-jang" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Seung Soon Jang</a> and the <a href="https://me.gatech.edu/faculty/lee-0" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Energy Storage and Conversion Lab</a> led by <a href="https://me.gatech.edu/faculty/lee-0" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Seung Woo Lee</a>. My research used multiscale atomistic modeling and machine learning to study energy materials, interfaces, and transport across a range of chemistries.</p>

<p>Previously, I was the <i>Computational Chemistry + ML PhD Resident</i> at <strong><a href="https://x.company" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Google [X]</a></strong> where I worked on AI-driven tools for automating materials discovery in a confidential moonshot.</p>

<p>Beyond science, I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, experimenting in the kitchen, and expanding my collection of vintage briar wood pipes.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out if you're interested in AI-accelerated materials discovery or would like to explore potential collaborations!</p>
