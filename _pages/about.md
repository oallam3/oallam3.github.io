<p>At <strong>SandboxAQ</strong>, I develop frameworks that integrate quantum mechanics and machine learning to accelerate and automate the evaluation of complex heterogeneous reaction mechanisms. I also work on methods to tie angstrom level phenomena to the mesoscale. Further, I work on developing and applying large-scale foundation models for applications in catalysis and energy storage.</p>

<p>Previously, I was the <strong>Computational Chemistry + ML PhD Resident</strong> at <strong>Google X</strong>. There I worked on AI-driven tools to automate materials discovery for high-impact, confidential projects.</p>

<p>In my work, I collaborate closely and regularly with experimental partners across academia and industry to bring functional materials to life.</p>

<p>Outside of research, you can often find me hiking, cooking up new dishes, mountain biking, or expanding my collection of vintage briar wood pipes.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out if you're interested in AI-accelerated materials discovery or want to explore collaboration opportunities!</p>
