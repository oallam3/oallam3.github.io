Hello! I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech in the [Computational NanoBio Technology Lab](https://cnbt.mse.gatech.edu) and the [Energy Conversion and Storage Lab](https://escl.gatech.edu). I am co-advised by [Prof. Seung Soon Jang](https://research.gatech.edu/seung-soon-jang) and [Prof. Seung Woo Lee](https://research.gatech.edu/seung-woo-lee).

Currently, my research interests broadly include using computational methods such as density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and machine learning to investigate a wide array of organic and hybrid organicâ€“inorganic materials for optoelectronics, and energy storage and conversion applications.
