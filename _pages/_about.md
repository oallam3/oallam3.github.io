<p>I am a <i>Postdoctoral Fellow</i> at <strong><a href="https://www.sandboxaq.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">SandboxAQ</a></strong>, where I focus on developing frameworks that integrate quantum mechanics and machine learning to accelerate and automate the evaluation of complex heterogeneous reaction mechanisms. My work also extends to connecting atomic-scale phenomena to the mesoscale and refining large-scale foundation models for applications in catalysis and energy storage.</p>

<p>Prior to this role, I earned my PhD from <strong><a href="https://www.gatech.edu" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Georgia Tech</a></strong>. There I worked at the juncture of a computational and an experimental group â€” the <a href="https://www.mse.gatech.edu/people/seung-soon-jang" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Computational NanoBio Technology Lab</a> led by <a href="https://www.mse.gatech.edu/people/seung-soon-jang" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Seung Soon Jang</a> and the <a href="https://me.gatech.edu/faculty/lee-0" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Energy Storage and Conversion Lab</a> led by <a href="https://me.gatech.edu/faculty/lee-0" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Seung Woo Lee</a>. My research utilized multiscale atomistic modeling and ML to design sustainable electrode and electrolyte materials for electrochemical energy storage devices. I also worked on engineering the electronic structure of perovskites and phase change materials to enhance their external quantum efficiency and phase stability.</p>

<p>Previously, I was the <i>Computational Chemistry + ML PhD Resident</i> at <strong><a href="https://x.company" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Google [X]</a></strong> where I worked on AI-driven tools for automating materials discovery in a confidential moonshot.</p>

<p>Outside the lab (or the cluster, I guess), I enjoy hiking, mountain biking, experimenting in the kitchen, and expanding my collection of vintage briar wood pipes.</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out if you're interested in AI-accelerated materials discovery or would like to explore potential collaborations!</p>
