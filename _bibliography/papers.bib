abstract={Optical encryption technologies based on room-temperature light-emitting materials are of considerable interest. Herein, we present three-dimensional (3D) printable dual-light-emitting materials for high-performance optical pattern encryption. These are based on fluorescent perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) designed for phosphorescent host-guest interactions. Notably, perovskite-containing MOFs emit a highly efficient blue phosphorescence, and perovskite NCs embedded in the MOFs emit characteristic green or red fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Such dual-light-emitting MOFs with independent fluorescence and phosphorescence emissions are employed in pochoir pattern encryption, wherein actual information with transient phosphorescence is efficiently concealed behind fake information with fluorescence under UV exposure. Moreover, a 3D cubic skeleton is developed with the dual-light-emitting MOF powder dispersed in 3D-printable polymer filaments for 3D dual-pattern encryption. This article outlines a universal principle for developing MOF-based room-temperature multi-light-emitting materials and a strategy for multidimensional information encryption with enhanced capacity and security.},

abstract  ="In this study{,} we investigate the molecular mechanisms of the microwave-driven selective heating process by performing molecular dynamics simulations for three different systems such as pure water{,} pure polyethylene oxide (PEO){,} and water-PEO mixed systems in the presence of microwave with two different intensities of electric field such as 0.001 V/Å and 0.01V/Å with a frequency of 100 GHz. First{,} from performing molecular dynamics simulations of CO and CO2 in the presence of the microwave{,} it is confirmed that the molecular dipole moment is responsible for the rotational motion induced by the oscillating electric field. Second{,} by analyzing the MD simulations of the pure water system{,} we discover that the dipole moment of water exhibits a time lag with respect to the microwave. During the heating process{,} however{,} the temperature{,} kinetic{,} and potential energies increase synchronously with the oscillating electric field of the microwave{,} showing that the heating of the water system is caused by the molecular reaction of water to the microwave. Comparing the water-PEO mixed system to the pure water and pure PEO systems{,} the water-PEO mixed system has a higher heating rate than the pure PEO system but a lower heating rate than the pure water system. Therefore{,} we conclude that heating the water-PEO mixed system is driven by water molecules selectively activated by microwave irradiation. We also calculate the diffusion coefficients of water molecules and PEO chains by describing their mean square displacements{,} demonstrating that the diffusion coefficients are increased in the presence of microwaves for both water and PEO in pure and mixed systems. Lastly{,} during the microwave heating process{,} the structures of the water-PEO mixed system are altered as a function of the intensity of electric field{,} which is mainly driven by the response of water molecules."}

abstract={Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites (RPPs) feature enhanced stability compared to their bulk counterparts and attract attention for potential applications in light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, to date, blue-emitting RPPs rely on halide compositional tuning, resulting in spectral shifts due to halide segregation under photo-/electrical-excitation. Here, efficient blue-emitting materials with single-halide RPPs using organic spacer engineering are reported. Experimental and computational results show that the (110)-oriented thin films exhibit larger bandgap and enhanced stability regardless of the choice of spacers, relative to the (100)-oriented RPPs. The correlation between the lattice structures and optoelectronic properties reveals that this new class of RPPs exhibits sky-blue emission at 483 nm with a quantum efficiency of ≈62%. Spearman correlation between the steric size of the spacers and the bandgap is estimated to be 92%, showing that the steric effect is crucial influencers. The protocol and strategy established in this study can be exploited to develop blue perovskite LEDs.},

As global interest in renewable energy continues to increase, there has been a pressing need for developing novel energy storage devices based on organic electrode materials that can overcome the shortcomings of the current lithium-ion batteries. One critical challenge for this quest is to find materials whose redox potential (RP) meets specific design targets. In this study, we propose a computational framework for addressing this challenge through the effective design and optimal operation of a high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) pipeline that enables rapid screening of organic materials that satisfy the desired criteria. Starting from a high-fidelity model for estimating the RP of a given material, we show how a set of surrogate models with different accuracy and complexity may be designed to construct a highly accurate and efficient HTVS pipeline. We demonstrate that the proposed HTVS pipeline construction and operation strategies substantially enhance the overall screening throughput.}

abstract={Organic materials with redox-active oxygen functional groups are of great interest as electrode materials for alkali-ion storage due to their earth-abundant constituents, structural tunability, and enhanced energy storage properties. Herein, a hybrid carbon framework consisting of reduced graphene oxide and oxygen functionalized carbon quantum dots (CQDs) is developed via the one-pot solvothermal reduction method, and a systematic study is undertaken to investigate its redox mechanism and electrochemical properties with Li-, Na-, and K-ions. Due to the incorporation of CQDs, the hybrid cathode delivers consistent improvements in charge storage performance for the alkali-ions and impressive reversible capacity (257 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1), rate capability (111 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1), and cycling stability (79% retention after 10 000 cycles) with Li-ion. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations uncover the CQD structure-electrochemical reactivity trends for different alkali-ion. The results provide important insights into adopting CQD species for optimal alkali-ion storage.},

abstract={Practical lithium–oxygen batteries require a shift from pure O2 to air. CO2 traces, however, fundamentally alter the O2 electrochemistry towards Li2CO3 formation via peroxocarbonate intermediates in highly-solvating electrolytes e.g., tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (G4). Here, we reveal that operating temperatures (0∼70 °C) critically dictate Li2CO3-associated cell overcharges (4.60∼3.77 V), by determining temperature-dependent reaction kinetics and evolving species mobility, as analogously witnessed under pure O2-conditions. Against what is observed for Li2O2 formation in the Li–O2 cell, however, cell temperatures do not govern the crystallinity of the Li2CO3 discharge product. In agreement with experimental observations, comprehensive density functional theory calculations also uncover the effect of the temperature on the Li2CO3 precipitation mechanism and shed light on the dwindling stabilization of metastable peroxocarbonate intermediates during discharge at increasing cycling temperatures. On the other hand, during extended operation, the temperature-dependent reactants mobility in the viscous G4 electrolyte and remnant Li-deficient carbonate surfaces from precedent recharge steps play equally prominent roles on the Li2CO3 precipitation mechanism and the resulting cell capacity. Our study highlights the complexity of practical Li–O2 cells with temperature-dependent performances.},

abstract={In this study, we propose a novel method of pKa prediction in a diverse set of acids, which combines density functional theory (DFT) method with machine learning (ML) methods. First, the DFT method with B3LYP/6-31++G**/SM8 is used to predict pKa, yielding a mean absolute error of 1.85 pKa units. Subsequently, such pKa values predicted from the DFT method are employed as one of 10 molecular descriptors for developing ML models trained on experimental data. Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Gaussian Process Regression, and Artificial Neural Network are optimized using three Pipelines: Pipeline 1 involving only hyperparameter optimization (HPO), Pipeline 2 involving HPO followed by a relative contribution analysis (RCA) and recursive feature elimination (RFE), and Pipeline 3 involving HPO followed by RCA and RFE on an expanded set of composite features. Finally, it is demonstrated that KRR with Pipeline 3 yields optimal pKa prediction at an MAE of 0.60 log units. This algorithm was then utilized to predict the pKa of 37 novel acids. The two most important features were determined to be the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule and the degree of oxidation of the acid. The predicted pKa values were documented for future reference.},

abstract = {Despite the ability to precisely tune their bandgap energies, mixed halide perovskites (MHPs) suffer from significant spectral instability, which obstructs their utilization for the rational design of light-emitting diodes. Here, we investigate the origin of the electroluminescence peak shifts in layered MHPs containing bromide and iodide. X-ray diffraction and steady-state absorption measurements prove effective integration of iodide into the cubic lattice and the spatially uniform distribution of halides in the ambient environment. However, the applied electric field during the device operation is found to drive the systematic halide migration. Quantum mechanical density functional theory calculations reveal that the different activation energies required for directional ion hopping lead to the redistribution of anions. In-depth analyses of the electroluminescence spectra indicate that the spectral shifting rate is dependent on the drift velocity of halides. Finally, it is suggested from our study that the dominant red emission is ascribed to the thermodynamically favorable selective hole injection. Our mechanistic study provides insights into the fundamental reason for the spectral instability of devices based on MHPs.},

These three protocols, or pipelines, are developed in order to enhance each model's capability to learn the data and make predictions. The first two pipelines utilize the original features only, while the third pipeline utilizes composite features which are screened by a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Particularly, the second and third pipelines employ a Pearson correlation analysis in conjunction with recursive feature elimination (RFE). From this study, the most important features to predict redox potential are identified as the electron affinity and the number of bound Li atoms. After optimizing machine learning models in each pipeline, it is found that KRR predicts the redox potential with the highest accuracy.},

The large-set of input variables are further downsized using a linear correlation analysis to have six core input variables, namely electron affinity, HOMO, LUMO, HOMO–LUMO gap, the number of oxygen atoms and the number of lithium atoms. The artificial neural network trained using the quasi-Newton method demonstrates a capability for accurately estimating the redox potentials. From the contribution analysis, in which the influence of each input on the target are accessed, we highlight that the electron affinity has the highest contribution to redox potential, followed by the number of oxygen atoms, HOMO–LUMO gap, the number of lithium atoms, LUMO, and HOMO, in order.},
